        <h2>Teacher</h2>
        <p>Hetty King embodied the spirit of the King family and the town of Avonlea. Hetty's strong stand for tradition
            and the importance of family and community was reflected in her fierce resistance to change. Her traditional
            beliefs would often conflict with the inevitable changing of times, not only among her family, but with the
            world at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
